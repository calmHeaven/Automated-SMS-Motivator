## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Set up your Twilio account by visiting [Twilio's website](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and signing up.
4. Obtain your Twilio account SID, auth token, and trial number from the Twilio console.
5. Update the `application.yaml` file with your Twilio credentials.
6. Build the project using Maven.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can send SMS messages by making POST requests to the `/sms/send` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```
{
  "phoneNumber": "RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER",
  "message": "YOUR_MESSAGE"
}
```

Replace `RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER` with the recipient's phone number and `YOUR_MESSAGE` with the message you want to send.

```
twilio:
accountSid=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID
authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
